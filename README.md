# Cpp-OpenGL-GameDemo

The goal of this project was to learn the principles of computer graphics and apply them on a simple playable game demo. 

Most of the CMAKE template was given to us by our tutor. Source: https://github.com/martinmadaras/ppgso. Especially useful code was in the ***/ppgso*** folder, which contains some low-level functions to control images and objects.

My code is located in ***/src/projekt*** folder.

File ***finalna_sprava.pdf*** contains documentation in slovak language.

All object models and textures located in ***/data*** folder are from https://free3d.com/

## Controls:

Scene 1:

WASD - move, mouse - move camera, F - interact

Scene 2:
AD - move, W - toggle wind, SPACE - jump, E - change camera view, R - restart scene 2, B - restart scene 1
