# Cpp-OpenGL-GameDemo

The goal of this project was to learn the principles of computer graphics and apply them on a simple playable game demo. 

Most of the CMAKE template was given to us by our tutor. Source: https://github.com/martinmadaras/ppgso. Especially useful code was in the ***/ppgso*** folder, which contains some low-level functions to control images and objects.

My code is located in ***/src/projekt*** folder.

File ***finalna_sprava.pdf*** contains documentation in slovak language.
